# Crab Crawler

## ü¶Ä About the Project

Crab Crawler is an 2D pixel art platformer game where you play as a crab that must make it's way to the sandcastle at the end of each level, all whilst avoiding predators, barnacles and staying hydrated. This project was initially developed early in my software engineering journey and served as a practical exploration into object-oriented programming principles and game development, with my own custom pixel art, sound design, custom music.

Recently, I revisited this project with a focus on web accessibility and deployment, demonstrating my commitment to maintaining and improving past projects.

For the best experience, use a modern web browser with WebGL support.

## üîÑ Development and Version Migration

Crab Crawler was originally developed in Unity version 2022.1.17f1. To leverage additional export and build settings, the project was later migrated to Unity 6. This migration demonstrates my adaptability and commitment to using the latest tools in game development.

The recent project revival focused on web deployment and accessibility improvements, showcasing my ability to return to past projects, implement new features, and adapt them for different platforms.
