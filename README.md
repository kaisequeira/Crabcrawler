# Crab Crawler

## ü¶Ä About the Project

Crab Crawler is an engaging 2D pixel art platformer game initially developed early in my software engineering journey. This project served as a practical exploration into object-oriented programming principles and game development, with my own custom pixel art, sound design, custom music and showcases my ability to apply computer science principles in an app development context.

Recently, I revisited this project with a focus on web accessibility and deployment, demonstrating my commitment to maintaining and improving past projects.

## üéì Learning Outcomes

Through the development and recent revival of Crab Crawler, I achieved several key learning outcomes:

- Practical application of object-oriented programming concepts
- Game development principles and best practices
- Proficiency in Unity engine and C# programming
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Web deployment using WebGL and GitHub Pages
- Cross-platform development (keyboard and controller support)
- Web accessibility implementation in game development
- Project revival and codebase adaptation for new platforms

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Visit the [Crab Crawler game page](https://kaisequeira.github.io/Crabcrawler-Deployment/)
2. Use arrow keys or WASD for movement (also supports controller)
3. Space bar, up arrow, w, or south button on controller to jump
4. Down arrow, s, or east button on controller to crouch
5. Explore the level and overcome obstacles!

For the best experience, use a modern web browser with WebGL support.

## üîÑ Development and Version Migration

Crab Crawler was originally developed in Unity version 2022.1.17f1. To leverage additional export and build settings, the project was later migrated to Unity 6. This migration demonstrates my adaptability and commitment to using the latest tools in game development.

The recent project revival focused on web deployment and accessibility improvements, showcasing my ability to return to past projects, implement new features, and adapt them for different platforms.
