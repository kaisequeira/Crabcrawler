# Crab Crawler

## ü¶Ä About the Project

Crab Crawler is a 2D pixel art platformer game where you play as a crab that must make it's way to the sandcastle at the end of each level, all whilst avoiding predators, barnacles and staying hydrated. This project was initially developed early in my software engineering journey and served as a practical exploration into object-oriented programming principles and game development, with my own custom pixel art, sound design, custom music.

Recently, I revisited this project with a focus on web accessibility and deployment, demonstrating my commitment to maintaining and improving past projects.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Immersive Pixel Art World
- Hand-crafted pixel art assets created using Aseprite
- State-based animation system using Unity's animation trees
- Integrated sound/music design triggered by code and enemy behaviour

### Cross Platform Input Handling
- Intuitive player controls with keyboard and controller support
- Menu navigation with keyboard and controller support

### WebGL Deployment
- Web-optimized for broad accessibility
- Deployed with WebGL via Github Pages

### Save System and Menus
- Save system for levels that works across different deployments (exe, web etc.)
- Settings menu to edit music, volume and fullscreen modes
- Pause menu system to stop physics engine, halt game audio and allow level navigation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **[Unity](https://unity.com/)**: Industry leading cross-platform game development engine
- **[Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)**: Used for creating custom pixel art assets
- **Bosca Ceoil**: A free, easy to use tool for creating music inspired by retro pixel art games
- **WebGL**: A JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser 
- **GitHub Pages**: A static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub and publishes a website

## üéì Learning Outcomes

Through the development and recent revival of Crab Crawler, I achieved several key learning outcomes:

- Practical application of object-oriented programming concepts
- Game development principles and best practices
- Proficiency in Unity engine and C# programming
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Web deployment using WebGL and GitHub Pages
- Cross-platform development (keyboard and controller support)
- Web accessibility implementation in game development
- Project revival and codebase adaptation for new platforms

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Visit [Crab Crawler's Deployment Repository](https://github.com/kaisequeira/Crabcrawler-Deployment) to see how to play.
2. [Play Crab Crawler](https://kaisequeira.github.io/Crabcrawler-Deployment/) here

For the best experience, use a modern web browser with WebGL support.

## üîÑ Development and Version Migration

Crab Crawler was originally developed in Unity version 2022.1.17f1. To leverage additional export and build settings, the project was later migrated to Unity 6. This migration demonstrates my adaptability and commitment to using the latest tools in game development.

The recent project revival focused on web deployment and accessibility improvements, showcasing my ability to return to past projects, implement new features, and adapt them for different platforms.
